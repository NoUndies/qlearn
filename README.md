Simple Q-learning script written in Octave/Matlab. Epsilon-greedily selects the best action based on a Q-matrix that is updated as the agent explores. In this case, the agent is rewarded for reaching the bottom right-hand square of the grid. Feel free to extend and update the implementation based on your own needs.
